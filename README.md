In the realm of biomedical image processing, the manual identification of white blood cells (WBCs) in peripheral blood smear analysis by experienced pathologists has long been a bottleneck, slowing down the diagnostic process. Recognizing the need for accelerated and precise analysis, our research proposes an innovative solution employing a UNET-based segmentation approach. Leveraging the U-net architecture, known for its contracting and expanding paths that form a distinctive U shape, we have fine-tuned it to yield superior results even with limited training images. This modification ensures efficiency in WBC identification, contributing significantly to reducing the time needed for blood smear image analysis.

Our methodology encompasses key steps, starting with image acquisition blood smear images from the LISC dataset, followed by advanced pre-processing techniques to get S,R and G color channels from the images to enhance image quality and remove noise. The core of our approach lies in the implementation of the U-net architecture for robust leukocyte segmentation. The experimental results showcase the efficacy of our modified U-net, demonstrating its potential to revolutionize the field of peripheral blood smear analysis, making it both rapid and accurate.
